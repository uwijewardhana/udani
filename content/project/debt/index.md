Debt collection is a massive industry, with in USA alone more than $50 billion recovered each year.
However, the information available is often limited and incomplete, and predicting whether a given
debtor would repay is inherently a challenging task. This has amplified research on debt recovery
classification and prediction models of late. This research considered three main mathematical, data
mining and statistical models in debt recovery classification, in logistic regression, artificial neural
networks and affinity analysis. It also compares the effectiveness of the above mentioned tools in
evaluating whether a debt is likely to be repaid. The construction and analysis of the models were
based on a fairly large unbalanced data sample provided by a debt collection agency. We have shown
that all three models could classify the debt repayments with a considerable accuracy, if the
assumptions of the models are satisfied.
