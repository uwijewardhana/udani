title: "Statistical models for the persistence of Hooded Plover on Mornington Peninsula using citizen science data"
event: "The Third Victorian Research Students' Meeting in Probability and Statistics / Building Bridges 2019 / Young Statisticians Conference 2019"

abstract: "The BirdLife International assessed in 2015, that 13% of bird species are threatened with extinction and extinction of many bird species has become a theme too frequently occurring around the world. Determining whether a bird species has become extinct or extant has become a difficulty exercise due to survey efforts being too costly and sighting data limited. This is especially affecting threatened birds.
However, because of citizen science data, the number of sightings has increased over the years (number of sightings in eBird database increased more than 20 million from 2012 to 2018).

The Hooded Plover is listed as a vulnerable bird species under IUCN red list assessment criteria. In this study we compared three different models to identify the effect of climate on extinction risk for the Hooded Plover in Mornington Peninsula in both temporal and spatial-temporal scales, which is a prerequisite for developing effective strategies to conserve them while identifying the factors effect for their persistence like climate change. In order to identify the climate change and citizen science effect for the persistence of Hooded Plover using citizen science data available from eBird which has a large amount of validated observational data for birds. The Hooded Plover is a non-migratory local bird in Australia, so we considered monthly data for our study. Initially probability of persistence models was used as a reference for determining the significant factors. It is useful to know if a forecast model provides better results than any reference model. Then, to identify the climate effect, we consider the mean monthly
temperature, and total monthly rainfall in hurdle models. To control for the growth in citizen science data, we consider the human population on the Mornington Peninsula.

The citizen science count data often include excess zeros for rare species like Hooded Plover in specific areas or time periods. Therefore, we compared zero-inflated hurdle models and zero inflated models using Poisson and Negative Binomial distributions and discuss extensions of these models while using count data in temporal and spatial-temporal structures to deal with those excess zeros. In both the temporal and spatial-temporal models the performance of the Negative Binomial distribution was superior while overcoming over-dispersion issue. Similar conclusions can be drawn from both temporal and spatial-temporal models. Temperature has a significant positive effect on the non-zero counts (i.e. higher counts of Hooded Plover are associated with higher temperature). Growth in citizen science effort, linked to population growth, explained the lower probability of a zero count.

This work shows that statistical models can be used to address the challenges associated with the use of citizen science data for monitoring the persistence of rare birds, while identifying factors affecting this persistence such as climate."
