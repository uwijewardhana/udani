title: "Modelling the effectiveness of a fox eradication program for local shorebirds using citizen science data"
event: "The Fourth Victorian Research Students' Meeting in Probability and Statistics / Building Bridges 2020"

abstract: "In the past fox predation was the greatest land-based threat for shorebird colonies on Phillip Island, Victoria, Australia. Regular fox control for 20 years reduced the fox population, but shorebirds and seabirds including the Little Penguin continued to be decimated. Therefore, a fox eradication program was started in 2006, with three phases called knock-down, clean-up and post-eradication. An effective knock-down was declared in 2011, heralding the start of the clean-up phase. 

The impact of fox eradication for local shorebirds has never been thoroughly assessed. This study aims to track the effects of the fox eradication program on abundance measures for local shorebird species found on Philip Island including the locally threatened Hooded Plover and Sooty Oystercatcher. The methods used break new ground for the field of eradication assessment.

We have used citizen science data for 2002 to 2017, extracted from the Atlas of Living Australia and two statistical methods to assess the impact of the fox eradication program. The first method is INLA modelling assuming a Negative Binomial distribution for the number of annual sightings, in order to confirm upward trends in shorebird numbers during the fox eradication program. The second method is a changepoint analysis to confirm the timings of the successive phases of the eradication process. 

All shorebird species considered exhibited significant positive abundance trends over this period and all changepoint methods consistently identified the start of the clean-up phase. However, there was less consistency in the case of the start of the knock-down phase.

The methods and citizen science data used in this analysis have been shown to be effective for judging the effectiveness of this predator control program. The INLA model has shown a significant increase in sightings of shorebirds on Phillip Island since the program start. Agreement in the changepoints identified by the four changepoint methods has validated the timing of the programâ€™s clean-up phase.

The application of the INLA method of modelling and changepoint methods with citizen science data can be recommended for identifying significant changes in abundance levels for future pest eradication programs."
