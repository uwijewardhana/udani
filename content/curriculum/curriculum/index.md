title: Extra curricular activities
summary: Udani Wijewardhana was an extra-ordinary character in her college and university times. She was a team member of college table-tennis team, music group, dancing group, mass media unit, buddhist society and science society and achieved all-island championships. She also passed 'sangeet visharad degree' with a first division and 'dharmacharya exam' with distinctions. These curricular activities, memberships and leaderships helps her to higher the self-esteem. Working hard and mastering new skills in a fun, relaxed and sometimes competitive setting allowed to be successful without the pressure of getting a good grade. Each extracurricular she engaged, provided her with another opportunity to expand her social network. The greatest advantages extracurricular activities given her are 'real world' skills such as goal setting, teamwork, time management, prioritisation, problem solving, analytical thinking, leadership and public speaking.
