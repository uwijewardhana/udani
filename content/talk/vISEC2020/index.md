abstract: "Bird extinctions are now occurring at a rate that far exceeds their speciation rate due to risk factors like climate change, habitat destruction, predation overhunting and toxic pollution. Each extinction diminishes the diversity and complexity of life on earth. If a bird species is lost, the benefits it might have been afforded are gone forever. There are no robust indicators of biodiversity conservation that can be used to complement existing national indicators of economic and social health. Therefore, this research addresses that important issue while implementing a robust persistence measure. The main objective of my research is to development of a novel and reliable measure of persistence to identify threatened bird species worldwide and extension of the results from birds to other animals."
